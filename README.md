# Project 4 - Twitter Hamburger

Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Hamburger menu
- [x] Dragging anywhere in the view should reveal the menu.
- [x] The menu should include links to your profile, the home timeline, and the mentions view.
- [x] The menu can look similar to the example or feel free to take liberty with the UI.
- [x] Profile page
- [x] Contains the user header view
- [x] Contains a section with the users basic stats: # tweets, # following, # followers
- [x] Home Timeline
- [x] Tapping on a user image should bring up that user's profile page

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Profile Page
- [ ] Implement the paging view for the user description.
- [ ] As the paging view moves, increase the opacity of the background screen. See the actual Twitter app for this effect
- [ ] Pulling down the profile page should blur and resize the header image.
- [ ] Account switching
- [ ] Long press on tab bar to bring up Account view with animation
- [ ] Tap account to switch to
- [ ] Include a plus button to Add an Account
- [ ] Swipe to delete an account


The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Hamburger icon to slide open and close contentView
    - Makes sure user dragging and hamburger button toggling works together
- [x] Pull to refresh

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Appdelegate and pushing views
2. Logging and Sign out flow
